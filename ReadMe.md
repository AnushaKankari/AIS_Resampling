# ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS BASED RESAMPLING FOR DEALING WITH CLASS IMBALANCE

### **Project Goal:**
Many real-world datasets suffer from the class imbalance problem.Frequently, either oversampling or undersampling strategies are applied to balance the dataset. From the past few decades, Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) defined as the intelligent computational algorithms inspired by the biological immune systems and gained a lot of attention.Researchers aimed to develop various immune-based algorithms to address the complex real-world problems for a wide variety of application domains. Namely, there has been some research works where AIS are applied to solve specific problems that suffer from the class imbalance problem. However, these methods were applied as the learning algorithm to solve the tasks and were not used as a resampling method. Only one work exists that uses some techniques of AIS to address the class imbalance problem.

The goal of this project is to explore the use of AIS as a data resampling strategy to tackle the class imbalance problem. In this study, we will test, evaluate and compare different approaches for integrating AIS techniques as resampling methods to address the class imbalance problem. Our experiments will be carried out using a set of the public available imbalanced data sets from Health and Fraud detection fields.
